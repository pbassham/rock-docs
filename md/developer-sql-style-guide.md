SQL Formatting Style Guide
==========================

Whenever you need to write SQL for a migration, tool or for sharing in the community please use the following conventions.

Example
```
  SELECT
      g.\[Id\]
      , g.\[Name\] + ' Group' AS \[GroupName\]
      , g.\[Guid\]
      , gt.\[Name\]
  FROM
      \[Group\] g
      INNER JOIN \[GroupType\] gt ON gt.\[Id\] = g.\[GroupTypeId\]
  WHERE
      gt.\[Id\] = 12
  ;
```
```
  INSERT INTO \[Group\]
       (\[Name\], \[IsSystem\], \[Guid\])
  VALUES
      ('Ted Decker Group', 0, 'A55B9391-B673-4FBD-4691-63388F41533A')
  ;
```
```
  UPDATE \[Group\]
      SET
          \[Name\] = 'Ted Decker Group'
          , \[IsSystem\] = 0
      WHERE \[Id\] = 12
  ;

```

Note the following:

*   All keywords are upper case
*   All tables and fields are enclosed in brackets (whether they are needed or not)
*   Joins should use the JOIN clause (WHERE clauses are for filters only)
