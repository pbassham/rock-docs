Lava 2.0 - Transition to the Fluid Engine
=========================================

**Summary**  
You may have heard that Lava is based on Shopify’s Liquid templating language but didn’t realize under the hood Rock has been using a library called DotLiquid which is being retired. No problem. We found a new library called Fluid that is 30-40% faster – but there are a few gotchas you might run into depending on how cryptic your Lava usage is. I’ll unpack the details and show you what to check to make sure your transition to Fluid is slippery smooth.
