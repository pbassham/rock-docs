Date Filters
============

These date filters allow you to modify the formatting of dates in some pretty cool ways!

**Now!** When working with dates you'll often want to get the current date/time. This is possible with the 'Now' keyword. You can use in places where you'd normally input a date/time to use the current date/time. Consider the example below which would display today's date like '8/3/2023'.
```
{{ 'Now' | Date:'M/d/yyyy' }}
    
<!-- New in V10 - No parameters are required to assign the current date/time.-->
<!-- However, it is advised you always specify the date format to avoid      -->
<!-- international confusion.                                                -->
{% assign now = 'Now' | Date %}
```

 [](#asdatetimeutc)

AsDateTimeUtc
=============

Show Details

Server: v14.1

Converts the input to a DateTime value in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

**Additional Details**

**Example:**

```
{{ '2018-05-02T03:00:00+04:00' | AsDateTimeUtc | Date:'yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:sszzz' }}
```

```
2018-05-01T23:00:00+00:00
```

**Note:**  
If the input date doesn't specify an offset, the current Rock application timezone is assumed.

 [](#date)

Date
====

Show Details

Server: v1.0 Mobile: v1.0

Displays the date given a format string. The string 'Now' can be used for the current date/time.

**Additional Details**

Value formatting elements include:

**Date Elements**

*   sd - Returns the culture's standard shortened date format (m/d/yyyy in the US)
*   d - Day of the month 1 - 31.
*   dd - Two digit day of the month 01 - 31.

*   yyyy - The year as a four-digit number

**Time Elements**

*   st - Returns the culture's standard shortened time format (h:mm am/pm in the US)
*   h - The hour, using a 12-hour clock from 1 to 12
*   hh - The hour, using a 12-hour clock from 01 to 12
*   H - The hour, using a 24-hour clock from 0 to 23

When the date is going to be saved to the database as an attribute value, we recommend you use the ISO standard format `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffzzz`

For even more options see the [Microsoft .Net Custom Date and Time Formatting Reference Guide](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8kb3ddd4(v=vs.110).aspx).

**Example:**

```
"Person": {
    "FirstVisit": "2/13/2011 8am"
}
```

```
Ted's first visit was on {{ Person | Attribute:'FirstVisit' | Date:'dddd, MMMM d, yyyy' }}.
```

```
Ted's first visit was on Sunday, February 13, 2011.
```

 [](#dateadd)

DateAdd
=======

Show Details

Server: v4.0 Mobile: v1.0

Adds a span of time to a provided date (default is in days).

**Additional Details**

By default this filter assumes the amount you pass in is in days. You can also pass in other intervals as a second parameter like:

{{ 'Now' | DateAdd:-12,'h' }}

This would subtract 12 hours from the current date/time.

Valid units are:

*   y - Years v8.0
*   M - Months v8.0
*   w - Weeks v8.0
*   d - Days
*   h - Hours
*   m - Minutes
*   s - Seconds

Adding weeks is simply a shorthand for adding by 7 days at a time.

**Example:**

```
"CurrentPerson": {
    "FirstVisit": "2/14/2011"
}
```

```
Your first visit was {{ CurrentPerson | Attribute:'FirstVisit' }}. Two weeks later would be {{ CurrentPerson | Attribute:'FirstVisit' | DateAdd:14 }}.
```

```
Your first visit was 2/14/2011. Two weeks later would be 2/28/2011.
```

**Note:**  

When adding months and years, if you are going from one month with more days than the target month, the day number will be reduced to fit within the new target month.

*   5/31/2018 + 1 month = 6/30/2018
*   2/29/2016 + 1 year = 2/28/2017

 [](#datediff)

DateDiff
========

Show Details

Server: v1.0 Mobile: v1.0

Takes two datetimes and returns the difference in the unit you provide. You can provide the value 'Now' for either the start or end date.

**Additional Details**

Valid units are:

*   Y - Years
*   M - Months
*   d - Days
*   h - Hours
*   m - Minutes
*   s - Seconds

**Example:**

```
"Person": {
    "FirstVisit": "2/14/2011",
    "SecondVisit": "3/18/2011"
}
```

```
It was {{ Person.FirstVisit | DateDiff:Person.SecondVisit,'d' }}
days between {{ Person.NickName }} first and second visit.

```

```
It was 32 days between Ted's first and second visit.
```

**Note:**  
If the start date is after the end date a negative number will be displayed. Note, the difference in days between January 1st at 11:59pm and January 2nd at 12:01am is 0 days, while the difference between January 1st and January 2nd (without the time portion) is 1 day.

Determine if the provided date falls within a given range.

**Additional Details**

This filter will accept input in the following formats:

*   String (that can be parsed into a date)
*   Date
*   DateTime
*   DateTimeOffset

The filter will attempt to parse each parameter (input, start of range, end of range) into a valid DateTime and check if the input falls within the range (inclusive). A boolean value will be returned.

**Example:**

```
"Items": \[
    { 
        "Id": 1, 
        "Title": "Easter Devotional",
        "FeaturedDates": "4/10/2022 to 4/20/2022"

        {% endif %}
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
```

```

Show Details

Server: v8.0 Mobile: v1.0

Advances the date to a specific day in the next 7 days.

**Additional Details**

==========

Show Details

Server: v5.0 Mobile: v1.0

Returns the Sunday date portion (without any time portion) of the date provided.

**Example:**

```
"CurrentPerson": {
    "FirstVisit": "2/14/2011"
}
```

```
You first visited on the week of {{ CurrentPerson | Attribute:'FirstVisit' | SundayDate }}.
```

```
You first visited on the week of 2/20/2011.
```

**Note:**  
To get the previous Sunday simply pipe the filter through DateAdd. `  {{ 'Now' | SundayDate | DateAdd:-7 }}  `

 [](#timeofday)

TimeOfDay
=========

Show Details

Server: v13.1

Returns a description of the time of day for an input value that represents a date/time. The keyword 'Now' can be used to represent the current time.

    "ThirdVisit": "2/14/2011 1pm",
    "FourthVisit": "3/18/2011 11:30am"
}
```

```
{{ Person.NickName }}'s third visit was in the {{ Person | Attribute:'ThirdVisit' | TimeOfDay }}, and the fourth visit was in the {{ Person | Attribute:'FourthVisit' | TimeOfDay }}.
```

```
Ted's first third was in the Afternoon, and the fourth visit was in the Morning.
```

**Note:**  
The time period returned by this filter is determined as follows:

*   Morning - 5:00:00am - 11:59:59am
