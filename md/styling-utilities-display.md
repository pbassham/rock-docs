Display Utilities
-----------------

Hide or show elements at various screen sizes and more with the following display utilities.

Change the value of the [`display` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) with our responsive display utility classes. We purposely support only a subset of all possible values for `display`. Classes can be combined for various effects as you need.

### Notation

Display utility classes that apply to all breakpoints, from `xs` to `lg`, have no breakpoint abbreviation in them. This is because those classes are applied from `min-width: 0;` and up, and thus are not bound by a media query. The remaining breakpoints, however, do include a breakpoint abbreviation.

As such, the classes are named using the format:

*   `.d-{value}` for `xs`
*   `.d-{breakpoint}-{value}` for `sm`, `md` and `lg` (as well as `print` for print styling).

Where _value_ is one of:

*   `none`
*   `inline`
*   `inline-block`
*   `block`
*   `table`
*   `table-cell`
*   `table-row`
*   `flex`
*   `inline-flex`

#### Examples

d-inline

d-inline

```
<div class="d-inline p-2 bg-primary text-white">d-inline</div>
<div class="d-inline p-2 bg-info text-white">d-inline</div>
```

#### Examples

d-block

d-block

```
<div class="d-block p-2 bg-primary text-white">d-block</div>
<div class="d-block p-2 bg-info text-white">d-block</div>
```

### Hiding Elements

For faster mobile-friendly development, use responsive display classes for showing and hiding elements by device. Avoid creating entirely different versions of the same site, instead hide elements responsively for each screen size.

To hide elements simply use the `.d-none` class or one of the `.d-{sm,md,lg}-none` classes for any responsive screen variation.

| Screen Size | Class |
| --- | --- |
| Hidden on all | `.d-none` |
| Hidden only on xs | `.d-none .d-sm-block` |
| Hidden only on sm | `.d-sm-none .d-md-block` |
| Hidden only on md | `.d-md-none .d-lg-block` |
| Hidden only on lg | `.d-lg-none` |
| Visible on all | `.d-block` |
| Visible only on xs | `.d-block .d-sm-none` |
| Visible only on sm | `.d-none .d-sm-block .d-md-none` |
| Visible only on md | `.d-none .d-md-block .d-lg-none` |
| Visible only on lg | `.d-none .d-lg-block` |

*   `.d-print-block`
*   `.d-print-table`
