Rockit SDK
==========

**Error**

![](/Content/RockExternal/Images/developer/rockit.png)

Let us kick start your development by creating a custom project for you with all the right details in all the right places.

*   **Note**: McKinley 14.0 is the last version we'll make for this Rockit SDK. We now recommend you use a fork/copy of [the Rock repo on Github](https://github.com/SparkDevNetwork/Rock) to manage your own plugins. You'll find this is a better experience because you can easily step though your code directly into the Rock core code when troubleshooting.
*   Rock v13 and higher requires Visual Studio 2019 and the [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4054531/microsoft-net-framework-4-7-2-web-installer-for-windows) with these workloads:
    *   ASP.NET and web development
    *   Node.js development
    *   .NET desktop development
