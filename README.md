# Searchable Rock RMS Documentation
I was frustrated with how many places I had to search to find answers to my Rock RMS questions, so I decided to create a single place to search for answers. This is a searchable version of the Rock RMS documentation. I plan to automate it to where it is updated daily.

## How to use
1. Enter your search term in the search box above.

## To Do
- [ ] Automate the process of updating the documentation.
- [ ] Fix link back to the official Rock RMS documentation at the top of each page.
- [ ] Add RockU video transcriptions
- [ ] find and replace "[](#link)section header" with "[section header](#link)" (have to do this rather than regular md links to not break all section links in docs)
- [ ] fix internal links by appending the filename before the [section heading](#link)
