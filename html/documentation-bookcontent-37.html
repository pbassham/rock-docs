    <p>
        We are all uniquely wired and given specific gifts, abilities, ways of thinking, and ways of solving problems. 
        In Rock we have implemented five assessments to empower your organization to understand your people more. The 
        results that come from these assessments can greatly help your workers better understand their strengths, calling 
        and fill needs based on your greater understanding of your organization’s members.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        By gathering assessment data on the people in your organization, both internal staff and other participants, 
        your organization can understand how individuals can fit into the best roles for their unique blend of strengths. 
        Additionally, you can use the assessment information in order to help guide your people with a fresh understanding. 
        You can find out the best ways to motivate and communicate with them to challenge them to greater engagement in 
        the body. You can use data views to filter people based on the results of any assessment in Rock in order to gather 
        them and generate reports on their assessment responses.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Here’s a list of all the available assessments: later we will break each one down individually. 
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>DISC</li>
        <li>Spiritual Gifts</li>
        <li>Emotional Intelligence</li>
        <li>Conflict Profile</li>

    <p>
        Before we get into each assessment one by one, let’s take a look at how requests are sent to groups or individuals. 
        Out of the box, Rock comes with these assessments ready to go, so you don’t have to do any background work.
    </p>

    <section data-type="sect1">

        <h1><a name='individualrequests' href='#individualrequests' class='book-link'><i class='fa fa-link'></i></a>Individual Requests</h1>
        
        <p>
            One way to send a request is through a person’s profile page. 
            This is done by clicking the Actions button located below the 
            person's photo. Click on the button and choose 
            <em data-type="reference" data-reference="reference-highlight">Request Assessment</em>. 
        </p>

        </figure>
        
        <p>
            A page will then show all five assessments to choose and add a message 
            to send with the request. You can select one assessment or multiple.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once the request has been sent, the person will receive the email with an external link to start the assessment. 
            They can also access the request and other assessments on their 
            <em data-type="reference" data-reference="reference-page">My Account</em> page on the external website.

    <p>
        The assessments are all taken in a similar way; however, each assessment will vary on the questions and type of answers provided. 
        These are not configurable. The assessments were heavily researched and designed to meet a huge audience. 
    </p>

    <p>
        It’s essential to keep a few things in mind while taking these assessments. One is to reflect on who you are at the time of taking the assessment. 
        It is tempting to answer questions based on who you aspire to be someday. 
        It is best to take a present approach to these questions. Another thing to keep in mind is your environment. 
        It’s possible you have two very different responses from how you would answer if you were home vs. at work. Throughout the whole assessment, 
        we encourage you to choose the same environment for each question.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        At the beginning of each chapter, we are going to start with a breakdown on how each assessment is structured. Let’s get started.

<section data-type="chapter" id="disc-personality-assessment"><h1><a name='discpersonalityassessment' href='#discpersonalityassessment' class='book-link'><i class='fa fa-link'></i></a>DISC Personality Assessment</h1>

    <p>
        The DISC assessment is like many other quadrant-style personality profiles. You may have seen some that divide all personalities 
        into four types or combinations of those types. Some tests show results as colors or animals. DISC takes that same concept but 
        uses letters to stand for each personality type.
    </p>

    <section data-type="sect1">

        <p>
           Here's a quick look at the four main types and some adjectives that describe them:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>D: dominant, driving, determined, decisive</li>
            <li>I: inspirational, impressive, influencing, impulsive</li>
            <li>S: steady, stable, specialized</li>
            <li>C: cautious, competent, consistent, conscientious</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Rock's DISC test delivers 16 different results that take into account letter types and combinations of any two or one. 
            We'll talk more about what each of these means in detail later in this chapter.
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <section data-type="sect1">
        <h1><a name='takingdisc' href='#takingdisc' class='book-link'><i class='fa fa-link'></i></a>Taking DISC</h1>
        
        <p>
            The DISC assessment has four statements. Out of the four, you will choose which one you are least like and which one you are most like.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the completion of the assessment, you will be presented with a bar graph showing your personality type
            with a few details underneath. Check out the <a href="#catalogoftypes">Catalog of Types</a> section below
            for greater details on the results of DISC.

            The actual DISC instrument algorithm provides for millions of combinations and allows for the many nuances of human behavior.  
            For the sake of Rock, we have simplified the reporting to allow for four levels within each of the four scales (DISC). Because 
            there are only four types (and their combinations), DISC results are therefore easy to remember and simple to apply in the 
            context of a team or structured messaging. While some assessments have a greater number of results and more complex typing 
            patterns, the goal of Rock is to simplify. Instead of delivering long, complicated and highly individualized results, Rock's 
            DISC assessment was created to support the application's focus on groups, group management, and customizable group experiences.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Not only that, but the DISC profiling tool has major implications for screening potential staff, encouraging emotional intelligence, 
            developing strong interpersonal relationships, predicting leadership behaviors and solving problems.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Once you get started, you'll see how easy it is to understand individuals in a new light, remember their profile results and apply that knowledge for results.

    <p>
       The Spiritual Gifts Assessment identifies the spiritual gifts an individual possesses. 
       While this is not a comprehensive list of spiritual gifts, 
       it does include those that are most commonly seen in action for most people.
    </p>

    <p>
        Empowering the members of your organization to make an impact starts with identifying their spiritual gifts. 
        From there, they are positioned to learn what these gifts are and how they fit into the functioning of your mission.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This assessment will identify clusters of dominant, supportive and other gifts for each person. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This is searchable through Data Views. If, for instance, you want to search for people to host new small groups in their homes, 
        you could create a person Data View and select the attribute ‘Dominant Gifts’ that includes ‘Hospitality’.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Each of the 17 spiritual gifts that are assessed are broken down with descriptions below.
    </p>

        The Motivators Assessment identifies what a person truly values, which drives their perspective and goals. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Because there are so many possible combinations of motivators, this assessment will demonstrate the unique set 
        of strengths and challenges a person will face. It would be advisable to look for opportunities that require 
        the strengths associated with a person’s top five to seven motivators, and to provide upwardly mobile 
        opportunities for those who have a high propensity for growth. It is also helpful to evaluate the bottom five 
        to seven motivators as venues that they should stay away from in serving if possible.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This assessment will identify the top theme or themes of motivators, along with the propensity for growth and the top five individual motivators.

        <p>
            Growth Propensity measures your perceived mindset on a continuum between a growth mindset and a fixed mindset. 
            These are two ends of a spectrum about how we view our capacity and potential. This number is a measurement of 
            the current propensity for growth, but that can change for an individual over time through applied effort and 
            awareness. Also, their growth propensity scale may be different from one area in their life to another.

<section data-type="chapter" id="emotional-intelligence"><h1><a name='emotionalintelligence' href='#emotionalintelligence' class='book-link'><i class='fa fa-link'></i></a>Emotional Intelligence</h1>

    <p>
        The Emotional Intelligence, or EQ, Assessment is a measure of individuals’ developed skills in 
        understanding the emotions of themselves and others, and appropriately harnessing their emotional responses. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Most people learn a habitual approach to emotions based on what they saw demonstrated early in their lives. 
        EQ is not static but can be developed through intentional effort and practice over time.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This assessment will provide a ranking of high, medium or low for each of the six EQ measurements. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This is searchable through Data Views. If, for instance, you want to search for people in your database who scored high on ‘Others-Awareness’ 
        for a new hospital visitors volunteer team, you would create a person Data View and select the attribute ‘Others-Awareness’ with a value of ‘High’. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Each of the six EQ measurements is described below.
    </p>
    
<section data-type="sect1">
    <h1><a name='takingeq' href='#takingeq' class='book-link'><i class='fa fa-link'></i></a>Taking EQ</h1>
    
    <p>
        The EQ assessment is similar to the format of the Spiritual Gifts assessment. 
        There is one statement with five multiple choice answers. Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Usually and Always. 
        On the assessment you can only choose one answer for each question.
    </p>

    </figure>
    
    <p>
        The results have five categories with a line graph from 1 – 100 which shows where you land for each category. 
        The five are Self Awareness, Self-Regulating, Others-Awareness, 
        Others- Regulating, EQ in problem solving and EQ under stress.

<section data-type="sect2">
    <h2>Self-Awareness</h2>
    
    <p>
        Self-Awareness is being aware of what emotions you are experiencing and why you are experiencing them. 
        This skill is demonstrated in real time. In other words, when you are in the midst of a discussion or even a 
        disagreement with someone else, ask yourself these questions:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Are you aware of what emotions you are experiencing?</li>
        <li>Are you aware of why you are experiencing these emotions?</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section data-type="sect2">
    <h2>Self-Regulating</h2>
    
    <p>
       Self-Regulating is appropriately expressing your emotions in the context of the relationships around you. 
       This doesn’t indicate suppressing emotions; rather the ability to express your emotions appropriately. 
       Healthy human beings experience a full range of emotions and these are important for family, friends and co-workers to understand. 
       Self-Regulating is learning to tell others what you are feeling in the moment.
    </p>
</section>

<section data-type="sect2">
    <h2>Others-Awareness</h2>
    
    <p>
       Others-Awareness is being aware of what emotions others are experiencing around you and why they are experiencing these emotions. 
       As with understanding your own emotions, this skill is knowing in real time what another person is experiencing. 
       This skill involves reading cues to their emotional state through their eyes, facial expressions, body posture, the tone of voice and many other ways.
    </p>
</section>

<section data-type="sect2">
    <h2>Others-Regulating</h2>
    
    <p>
       Others-Regulating is helping those around you express their emotions appropriately in the context of your relationship with them. 
       This skill centers on helping others know what emotions they are experiencing and then asking questions or giving them permission 
       to freely and appropriately express their emotions in the context of your relationship.

    <p>
       The final two measurements are particularly useful for those who are in leadership roles.
    </p>
    
<section data-type="sect2">
    <h2>EQ in Problem Solving</h2>
    
    <p>
       EQ in Problem Solving identifies how proficient you are at using emotions to solve problems. 
       This skill requires first being aware of what emotions are involved in the problem and what is the source of those emotions. 
       It also includes helping others (and yourself) express those emotions appropriately in the context of the situation.
    </p>
</section>

<section data-type="sect2">
    <h2>EQ Under Stress</h2>
    
    <p>
       EQ Under Stress identifies how capable you are of keeping high EQ under high-stress moments; which is particularly challenging. 
       This skill requires highly developed Self- and Others-Awareness to understand the impact of the current stress. 
       It also involves being able to articulate the appropriate emotions under pressure which may be different from articulating them when not under stress.

<section data-type="chapter" id="conflict-profile"><h1><a name='conflictprofile' href='#conflictprofile' class='book-link'><i class='fa fa-link'></i></a>Conflict Profile</h1>

    <p>
        The Conflict Engagement Assessment is a measure of how individuals see themselves responding to 
        conflict in a given setting. This may or may not be a fully accurate picture, depending on their self-awareness during a conflict.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most people feel comfortable using a few approaches based on what they saw demonstrated early in their lives. 
        And most people have different natural responses in different settings. However, everyone is capable of using all five modes; 
        it just takes some effort to develop those they aren’t as familiar with.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This assessment will provide a ranking of high, medium or low for each of the five Conflict Engagement Modes. 
        It will also provide an overall Conflict Engagement Theme which helps visualize how a person will resolve problems within a team or group setting.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This is searchable through Data Views. If, for instance, you want to search for people in your database who scored high on the Conflict Engagement 
        Theme ‘Solving’ for new group leader roles, you would create a person Data View and select the attribute ‘Solving’ with a value of ‘High’. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Each of the five Conflict Engagement Modes and three Conflict Engagement Themes are described below.
    </p>
    
<section data-type="sect1">
    <h1><a name='takingtheassessment' href='#takingtheassessment' class='book-link'><i class='fa fa-link'></i></a>Taking the Assessment</h1>
    
    <p>
        This assessment has four multiple choice answers for a statement. Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Agree and Strongly Agree.
    </p>

    <h1><a name='conflictengagementmodes' href='#conflictengagementmodes' class='book-link'><i class='fa fa-link'></i></a>Conflict Engagement Modes</h1>
    
<section data-type="sect2">
    <h2>Winning</h2>
    
    <p>
        Winning means you prefer competing over cooperating. You believe you have the right answer and you desire to prove you are right, 
        whatever it takes. This may include standing up for your own rights, beliefs or position.
    </p>
</section>

<section data-type="sect2">
    <h2>Resolving</h2>
    
    <p>
        Resolving means you attempt to work with the other person in depth to find the best solution, regardless of who appears to get 
        the most immediate benefit. This involves digging beneath the presenting issue to find a solution that offers benefit to both parties, and can take more time than other approaches.
    </p>
</section>

<section data-type="sect2">
    <h2>Compromising</h2>
    
    <p>
        Compromising means you find a middle ground in the conflict. This often involves meeting in the middle or 
        finding some mutually agreeable point between both positions. This is useful for quick solutions.
    </p>
</section>

<section data-type="sect2">
    <h2>Avoiding</h2>
    
    <p>
        Avoiding means not pursuing your own rights or those of the other person. You typically do not address the 
        conflict at all, if possible. This may be diplomatically sidestepping an issue or staying away from a threatening situation.
    </p>
</section>

<section data-type="sect2">
    <h2>Yielding</h2>
    
    <p>
        Yielding means neglecting your own interests while giving in to those of the other person. 
        This is self-sacrificing and maybe charitable; serving or choosing to obey another when you prefer not to.
    </p>
</section>
    
    <p>
        Frequently these modes are combined into a Conflict Engagement Theme. 
        This assessment will also provide a high, medium or low ranking for each of the three themes.
    </p>
    
</section>

<section data-type="sect1">
    <h1><a name='conflictengagementthemes' href='#conflictengagementthemes' class='book-link'><i class='fa fa-link'></i></a>Conflict Engagement Themes </h1>

<section data-type="sect2">
    <h2>Solving</h2>
    
    <p>
        Solving describes those who seek to use both Resolving and Compromising modes for solving conflict. 
        By combining these two modes, they seek to solve problems as a team. 
        Their leadership styles are highly cooperative and empowering for the benefit of the entire group.
    </p>
</section>

<section data-type="sect2">
    <h2>Accommodating</h2>
    
    <p>
        Accommodating combines Avoiding and Yielding modes for solving conflict. They are most effective in 
        roles where allowing others to have their way is better for the team, such as support roles or 
        roles where an emphasis on the contribution of others is significant.
    </p>
</section>

<section data-type="sect2">
    <h2>Winning</h2>
    
    <p>
        Winning is not a combination of modes, but a theme that is based entirely on the Winning model alone for solving conflict. 
        This theme is important for times when quick decisions need to be made and is essential for roles such as sole-proprietor.

    <p>
        After an assessment has been taken it's possible to take it again, but you may need to adjust some 
        configuration to allow it.
    </p>

    <section data-type="sect1">

        <h1><a name='assessmenttypeconfiguration' href='#assessmenttypeconfiguration' class='book-link'><i class='fa fa-link'></i></a>Assessment Type Configuration</h1>
        <p>
            The Assessment Type configuration can be accessed by navigating to 
            <span data-type="action" data-action="action-navigation">Admin Tools > System Settings > Assessment Types</span>.
            From there you can select an assessment type to view or edit its settings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each Assessment Type has a setting which controls how much time must pass after an assessment is
            completed before the same assessment can be taken again by the same person. By default, this is
            set to one year (365 days), but this can be adjusted as pictured below.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Another aspect to consider is whether the assessment requires a formal request for the 
            person to take it. By default, this is turned off, so a request does not need to be sent in order
            for someone to take the assessment. This too can be set within the Assessment Type configuration
            pictured below.
